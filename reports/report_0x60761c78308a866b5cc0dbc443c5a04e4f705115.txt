Average Transaction Size: $0.00 (Classification: Small)
Total 30-Day Volume: $0.00 (0.0% of total wallet value)

Top Assets in Transactions:
1. ETH: 100.0% (Direction: Distributing)

Average Daily Transactions: 0.1
Analysis: The wallet exhibits a low transaction volume and frequency, with an average transaction amount of just $0.00 per transaction. This suggests that the wallet is not being used for regular financial activities.

The wallet primarily holds ETH (100%), and the distribution pattern indicates that it may be used for distributing ETH to other wallets.

║ 🤖 BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS
    Classification: Likely Human
    Confidence Level: High
    Key Indicators:
        Average Gas Used: 49175.00
        Average Gas Price (Gwei): 10.00
        Repetitive Trading Hours: 0.00%
        Repetitive Trading Days: 0.00%
    Analysis: **Analysis of Ethereum Wallet Behavior Data**

**Classification:** Likely Human

**Confidence:** High

**Key Indicators:**

* **Avg Gas Used:** 49175.00
* **Avg Gas Price:** 10.00
* **Repetitive Hours:** 0.00%
* **Repetitive Days:** 0.00%

**Analysis:**

Based on the provided data, it is highly likely that this Ethereum wallet is operated by a human rather than a bot.

* **Gas Consumption:** The average gas used (49175.00) is significantly higher than what bots typically consume. Bots are programmed to minimize gas consumption to reduce transaction costs.

* **Gas Price:** The average gas price (10.00) is also higher than what bots usually set. Bots are designed to prioritize speed and will often pay higher gas prices to ensure their transactions are processed faster.

* **Time Patterns:** The absence of repetitive hours and days indicates that the wallet is not being used by a bot. Bots are typically configured to perform actions at specific times or days.

**Conclusion:**

The combination of high gas consumption, higher-than-average gas price, and lack of repetitive patterns strongly suggests that this Ethereum wallet is operated by a human being. The user is likely making deliberate decisions about gas prices and transaction timing, which are not typical characteristics of bot behavior.
