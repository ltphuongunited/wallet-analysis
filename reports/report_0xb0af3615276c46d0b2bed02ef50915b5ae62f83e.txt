║ 💰 TRANSACTION ANALYSIS
Average Transaction Size: $0.04 (Classification: Small)
Total 30-Day Volume: $1.05 (0.0% of total wallet value)

Top Assets in Transactions:
1. ETH: 100.0% (Direction: Distributing)

Average Daily Transactions: 0.9
Analysis: **Transaction Behavior Analysis:**

* **Low Transaction Size:** The average transaction size of $0.04 indicates micropayments or fractional transactions, suggesting potential use in small-scale financial activities or micro-transactions.
* **Moderate Transaction Frequency:** A daily transaction frequency of 0.9 suggests a relatively modest level of activity, with transactions occurring approximately every 26 hours on average.
* **Negligible Volume:** The volume of transactions relative to the total value stored in the wallet (0.0%) indicates a very small portion of the wallet's assets are being actively traded or transferred. This suggests that the wallet is primarily used for storage or infrequent transactions.
* **Asset Distribution:** The wallet holds 100% ETH and has a "Distributing" pattern for ETH, indicating that it is actively sending out ETH rather than receiving it. This suggests a role as an intermediary or exchange for ETH transactions.

**Concise Interpretation:**

The wallet engages in small-scale financial activities or micro-transactions, with an average transaction size of $0.04. It has moderate transaction frequency and a very low volume relative to the wallet's value. The wallet primarily holds ETH and distributes it frequently, indicating a possible role as an intermediary or exchange.

║ 🤖 BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS
    Classification: Likely Human
    Confidence Level: High
    Key Indicators:
        Average Gas Used: 126654.46
        Average Gas Price (Gwei): 7.85
        Repetitive Trading Hours: 10.00%
        Repetitive Trading Days: 20.00%
    Analysis: **Analysis**

The wallet behavior data indicates that the wallet is likely operated by a human. This conclusion is based on the following key indicators:

* **Avg Gas Used:** The average gas used by the wallet is 126654.46. This is a relatively high amount of gas, which is typically used by human-operated wallets. Bots, on the other hand, typically use lower amounts of gas to minimize their operating costs.
* **Avg Gas Price:** The average gas price paid by the wallet is 7.85. This is a relatively high gas price, which is also typically used by human-operated wallets. Bots, on the other hand, typically use lower gas prices to minimize their operating costs.
* **Repetitive Hours:** The wallet exhibits 10% repetitive hours, meaning that it is active during the same hours each day. This is a pattern that is more consistent with human behavior than bot behavior. Bots, on the other hand, are typically active at all hours of the day.
* **Repetitive Days:** The wallet exhibits 20% repetitive days, meaning that it is active on the same days each week. This is also a pattern that is more consistent with human behavior than bot behavior. Bots, on the other hand, are typically active on all days of the week.

**Conclusion**

Overall, the wallet behavior data indicates that the wallet is likely operated by a human. This conclusion is based on the high average gas used, high average gas price, repetitive hours, and repetitive days.
